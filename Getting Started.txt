The application consists of two main parts:

1. The built state of the project which is the "build" folder
  - It is the ready files that will later be deployed to the hosting server

2. The actual production files which are everything else, especially, "src" & "public" folders
  - "public" contains the icons and SEO configurations and the index.html file
  - index.html should only be used to add icons, fonts, metadata, etc. to the head tag. Do not change the body tag for simple projects.

  - "src" contains all the important parts of the app. react components, JavaScript files, css files, all assets
